üìÅ Project Structure
The FemiStore platform is composed of multiple microservices and a frontend module, each handling a specific aspect of the e-commerce ecosystem:

Order Management Microservice (gestion_commandes): Manages customer orders, order items, and statuses.
Product Management Microservice (femi-store-product): Handles product creation, updates, and advanced search with currency conversion.
Stock Management Microservice (TesnimStock): Manages inventory, stock trends, and demand forecasting.
Review Management Microservice (gestion_avis): Manages customer reviews, ratings, and alerts for significant rating drops.
Categories Module (femi-store-product/categories): Manages product categories and subcategories with a Spring Boot backend and Angular frontend.
